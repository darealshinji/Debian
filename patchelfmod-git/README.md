PatchELFmod
===========

**PatchELFmod** is a simple utility to modify header data of ELF executables
and libraries. It can change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter")
of executables, change existing DT_SONAME entries of shared libraries
and manipulate the RPATH and DT_NEEDED entries of executables and libraries.
