XnViewMP
========

Graphic viewer, browser, converter.

XnView MP is the enhanced version to XnView.
It is a powerful cross-platform media browser, viewer and converter.
And it's compatible with more than 500 formats.

This script downloads XnViewMP for GNU/Linux and creates a proper
Debian package including some extra Qt libraries to provide video preview (tested on Ubuntu 14.04).
