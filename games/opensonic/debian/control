Description: Free "Sonic the Hedgehog" clone
 Open Sonic is a free open-source game based on the "Sonic the Hedgehog"
 universe. It introduces a different style of gameplay called cooperative
 play, in which it's possible to control 3 characters simultaneously.
 Unlike most similar games, Open Sonic provides a greater level of
 interaction between the player and the levels. It's more than just a
 jump'n'run; the user must come up with some strategy in order to get
 through the levels.
