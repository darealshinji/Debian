Open Sonic
==========

Open Sonic is a free open-source game based on the "Sonic the Hedgehog" universe.
It introduces a different style of gameplay called cooperative play, in which it's
possible to control 3 characters simultaneously.
Unlike most similar games, Open Sonic provides a greater level of interaction between
the player and the levels. It's more than just a jump'n'run; the user must come
up with some strategy in order to get through the levels.

Note: Even if the source code is available a precompiled x86 version will be downloaded.
This is because of sound problems I had encountered.
