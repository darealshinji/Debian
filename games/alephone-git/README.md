Aleph One
=========

Aleph One is the open source continuation of Bungie's Marathon 2 game engine.
Available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, Aleph One supports [Marathon](../marathon-trilogy),
[Marathon 2](../marathon-trilogy) and [Marathon Infinity](../marathon-trilogy) natively. Many third party scenarios and net
maps are also available.

This Makefile will package my personal [fork](https://github.com/darealshinji/aleph-one), which contains a few build-related fixes.
