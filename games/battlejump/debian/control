Description: arcade/platform/race game inspired by Monster Farm Jump
 Battle Jump is a dexterity game in which you incarnate a character that can
 only move by making leaps.
 .
 You must bring your Jumper at the end of levels filled with traps.
 Your skills will be sorely tested, and your only goal will be to finish the
 level the faster you can.
