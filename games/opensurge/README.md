Open Surge
==========

Open Surge is a free open source retro-style 2D sidescroller inspired by "Sonic the Hedgehog".
It introduces a different style of gameplay called cooperative play, in which
it's possible to control 3 characters simultaneously.
Unlike most similar games, Open Surge provides a greater level of interaction between the player and the levels.
It's more than just a jump'n'run; the user must come up with some strategy in order to get through the levels.
Join Surge, Neon and Charge and save the world from the evil Gimacian the Dark!

This game is still beta and very short (actually just a demo).
