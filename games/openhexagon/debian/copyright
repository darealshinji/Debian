Copyright: 2013-2016 Vittorio Romeo
License: AFL-3.0
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of 
 authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the 
 following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original 
 Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0
 .
 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
 non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to 
 do the following:
 .
 a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a 
 collective work;
 .
 b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original 
 Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the 
 Original Work;
 .
 c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative 
 Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not 
 contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and 
 remedies, in this Academic Free License;
 .
 d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 .
 e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
 non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled 
 by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the 
 Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for 
 sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred 
 form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available 
 documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to 
 provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along 
 with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor 
 reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable 
 copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to 
 permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor 
 continues to distribute the Original Work.
 .
 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the 
 names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks 
 or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from 
 this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except 
 as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to 
 Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other 
 intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer 
 for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than 
 the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the 
 trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. 
 Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from 
 licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that 
 Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
 .
 5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, 
 distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in 
 any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone 
 other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those 
 persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. 
 As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat 
 any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a 
 distribution under section 1(c).
 .
 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative 
 Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the 
 Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any 
 descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must 
 cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a 
 prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that 
 You have modified the Original Work.
 .
 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that 
 the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted 
 herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under 
 the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those 
 copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately 
 preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an 
 "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, 
 without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or 
 fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE 
 ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an 
 essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by 
 this License except under this disclaimer.
 .
 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, 
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the 
 Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or 
 consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or 
 the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss 
 of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
 other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not 
 apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
 .
 9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to 
 this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of 
 this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or 
 communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a 
 reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of 
 recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights 
 to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to 
 create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without 
 honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and 
 international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright 
 exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This 
 License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the 
 rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the 
 conditions in Section 1(c).
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically 
 and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this 
 License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or 
 counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original 
 Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an 
 action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with 
 other software or hardware.
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to 
 this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the 
 Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and 
 under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. 
 The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original 
 Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be 
 subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the 
 appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this 
 License.
 .
 12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or 
 seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to 
 recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable 
 attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including 
 any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this 
 License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be 
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary 
 to make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, 
 whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity 
 exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this 
 License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is 
 controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this 
 definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
 direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or 
 (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or 
 (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise 
 restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises 
 not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
 .
 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright Â© 2005 Lawrence 
 Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License 
 without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this 
 License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You 
 may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your 
 modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original 
 works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not 
 indicate in any way that your Modified License is the "Academic Free License" 
 or "AFL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified 
 License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph 
 above with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or 
 with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in 
 this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open 
 source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source 
 Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification 
 process.

 GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
 .
 Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
 .
 Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
 permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
 bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
 the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
 .
 When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
 certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
 program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
 non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
 header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
 .
 0. Definitions.
 .
 A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
 Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
 interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
 on the Runtime Library.
 .
 "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
 modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
 the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
 subsequent versions published by the FSF.
 .
 "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
 modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
 the license of GCC.
 .
 "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
 target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
 input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
 phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
 format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
 for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
 .
 The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
 non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
 Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
 use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
 part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
 understood as starting with the output of the generators or
 preprocessors.
 .
 A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
 with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
 work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
 optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
 Eligible Compilation Process.
 .
 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
 .
 You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
 combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
 propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
 all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
 may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
 consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
 .
 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
 .
 The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
 presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
 requirements of the license of GCC.
