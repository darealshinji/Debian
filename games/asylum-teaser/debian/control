Description: Psychological horror adventure inspired by H. P. Lovecraft
 In Asylum, you set out on a chilling journey through the intricate
 floors of the Hanwell Mental Institute, which has seen unimaginable
 atrocities in the past. Decay surrounds you; dread awaits you around
 every corner. As you traverse the endless corridors of the asylum,
 a disconcerting feeling of imprisonment creeps up on you...
 .
 Asylum is the upcoming psychological horror adventure game by Senscape
 and inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, set in a massive mental institute that
 is far past its prime. Over four years in production, it aims to marry
 cutting edge visuals with thrilling storytelling to give players the
 ultimate experience of fear.
 .
 This is a very short demo not featuring actual content from the game.
 It's intended as a first glimpse into the sort of atmosphere and gameplay
 that can be found in Asylum. We're making its source code available for
 fun and educational purposes. The engine behind this project - Dagon - has
 also been open sourced here: https://github.com/Senscape/Dagon
