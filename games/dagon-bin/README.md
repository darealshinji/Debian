Dagon (precompiled binary)
==========================

Dagon is a game engine especially tailored for adventure games and based
on open technologies. Featuring a deceptively simple scripting language,
blazing fast performance and high portability supporting Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X and iOS devices, the project aims to become a reference of the genre.
