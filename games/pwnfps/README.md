pwnfps engine
=============

An incomplete game engine made for 7DFPS 2014 using C and a bit of Lua.

It's a realtime raytracer that happens to be pretty shiny.

Some stuff to do if you intend on using this:
 * Add Lua bindings for key presses and camera placement/orientation.
 * Move the player physics from C to Lua.
 * Make it possible to win and/or die.
