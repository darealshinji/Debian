 KEN'S LABYRINTH SOURCE CODE LICENSE TERMS:                        07/01/2001
 .
 [1] I give you permission to make modifications to my Ken's Labyrinth source
     and distribute it, BUT:
 .
 [2] Any derivative works based on my Ken's Labyrinth source may be
     distributed ONLY through the INTERNET and free of charge - no
     commercial exploitation whatsoever.
 .
 [3] Anything you distribute which uses a part of my Ken's Labyrinth source
     code MUST include the following message somewhere in the archive:
 .
     "Ken's Labyrinth" Copyright (c) 1992-1993 Ken Silverman
     Ken Silverman's official web site: "http://www.advsys.net/ken"
 .
     Including this README.TXT file along with your distribution is the
     recommended way of satisfying this requirement.
 .
 [4] Technical support: The code is so old that I am NOT interested in wasting
     my time answering questions about it. If you can't figure out how to
     compile the code, or you can't figure out what the code is doing,
     then that's your problem.
