 Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005
 .
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
 framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
 others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font
 names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license.
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:
     font files
     data files
     source code
     build scripts
     documentation
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by
 users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
 components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.
