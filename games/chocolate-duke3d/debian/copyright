 "Build Engine & Tools" Copyright (c) 1993-1997 Ken Silverman
 .
 BUILD SOURCE CODE LICENSE TERMS:                             06/20/2000
 .
 [1] I give you permission to make modifications to my Build source and
        distribute it, BUT:
 .
 [2] Any derivative works based on my Build source may be distributed ONLY
        through the INTERNET.
 .
 [3] Distribution of any derivative works MUST be done completely FREE of
        charge - no commercial exploitation whatsoever.
 .
 [4] Anything you distribute which uses a part of my Build Engine source
        code MUST include:
 .
    [A] The following message somewhere in the archive:
 .
        // "Build Engine & Tools" Copyright (c) 1993-1997 Ken Silverman
        // Ken Silverman's official web site: "http://www.advsys.net/ken"
        // See the included license file "BUILDLIC.TXT" for license info.
 .
    [B] This text file "BUILDLIC.TXT" along with it.
 .
    [C] Any source files that you modify must include this message as well:
 .
        // This file has been modified from Ken Silverman's original release
 .
 [5] The use of the Build Engine for commercial purposes will require an
        appropriate license arrangement with me. Contact information is
        on my web site.
 .
 [6] I take no responsibility for damage to your system.
 .
 [7] Technical support: Before contacting me with questions, please read
        and do ALL of the following!
 .
    [A] Look through ALL of my text files. There are 7 of them (including this
           one). I like to think that I wrote them for a reason. You will find
           many of your answers in the history section of BUILD.TXT and
           BUILD2.TXT (they're located inside SRC.ZIP).
 .
    [B] If that doesn't satisfy you, then try going to:
 .
              "http://www.advsys.net/ken/buildsrc"
 .
           where I will maintain a Build Source Code FAQ (or perhaps I might
           just provide a link to a good FAQ).
 .
    [C] I am willing to respond to questions, but ONLY if they come at a rate
           that I can handle.
 .
              PLEASE TRY TO AVOID ASKING DUPLICATE QUESTIONS!
 .
           As my line of defense, I will post my current policy about
           answering Build source questions (right below the E-mail address
           on my web site.) You can check there to see if I'm getting
           overloaded with questions or not.
 .
           If I'm too busy, it might say something like this:
 .
                I'm too busy to answer Build source questions right now.
                Sorry, but don't expect a reply from me any time soon.
 .
           If I'm open for Build source questions, please state your question
              clearly and don't include any unsolicited attachments unless
              they're really small (like less than 50k). Assume that I have
              a 28.8k modem. Also, don't leave out important details just
              to make your question appear shorter - making me guess what
              you're asking doesn't save me time!
 .
