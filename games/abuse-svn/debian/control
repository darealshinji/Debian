Description: classic Abuse action game
 A classic 2D side-scrolling shoot-em-up action game from Crack dot Com.
 Your character is a cyborg escaping from an underground prison where several
 inmates have transformed into mutants after being infected with a substance
 called Abuse.  You move through a building complex fighting enemies and
 defense systems you encounter on the way. Initially, you start off
 having a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more
 powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or
 lightsabers. There are also power-ups that augment your capabilities,
 allow you to increase your health limit, move faster, turn invisible and
 even fly. If you're one to get easily addicted, stay away!
