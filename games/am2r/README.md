Another Metroid 2 Remake (demo)
===============================

Project AM2R aims to recreate Metroid 2 with updated graphics and gameplay.
Taking elements from newer Metroid titles: the fast paced gameplay of Metroid: Zero Mission,
the atmosphere and solitude of Super Metroid, and adding new game mechanics,
AM2R is one of the most ambitious Metroid fan games.

Features:
 * Metroid Zero Mission style gameplay
 * Map system
 * Updated enemy AI
 * Minibosses
 * New areas
 * Challenging Metroid fights
 * Stackable beam system
 * Completely redrawn enemy and Metroid sprites
 * Log system with non-intrusive narrative
 * High quality soundtrack


NOTE: The game is not finished. The end of the demo will be triggered upon reaching a specific part of the map.
