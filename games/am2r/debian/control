Description: Another Metroid 2 Remake (demo)
 Project AM2R aims to recreate Metroid 2 with updated graphics and gameplay.
 Taking elements from newer Metroid titles: the fast paced gameplay of
 Metroid: Zero Mission, the atmosphere and solitude of Super Metroid, and
 adding new game mechanics, AM2R is one of the most ambitious Metroid fan
 games.
 .
 Features:
  * Metroid Zero Mission style gameplay
  * Map system
  * Updated enemy AI
  * Minibosses
  * New areas
  * Challenging Metroid fights
  * Stackable beam system
  * Completely redrawn enemy and Metroid sprites
  * Log system with non-intrusive narrative
  * High quality soundtrack
 .
 The game is not finished. The end of the demo will be triggered upon reaching
 a specific part of the map.
