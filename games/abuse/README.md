Abuse
=====

A classic 2D side-scrolling shoot-em-up action game from Crack dot Com.
Your character is a cyborg escaping from an underground prison where several
inmates have transformed into mutants after being infected with a substance called Abuse.
You move through a building complex fighting enemies and defense systems you encounter on the way.
Initially, you start off having a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more
powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers.
There are also power-ups that augment your capabilities, allow you to increase your health limit,
move faster, turn invisible and even fly.
If you're one to get easily addicted, stay away!
