 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which
 a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 make reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
    through textual modification.
    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
    or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
    the package.
    "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
    media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
    (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only
    to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
    there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
    of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
 Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
 the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
 from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
 a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
 you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
 changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
    such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
    modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
    standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
    manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
    differs from the Standard Version.
 .
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
 form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
    get the Standard Version.
 .
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
    Package with your modifications.
 .
    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
    Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names,
    and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
    together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
 You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge
 a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in
 aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
 commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
 as a product of your own.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
 from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright
 of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially,
 and may be aggregated with this Package.
 .
 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
 be considered part of this Package.
 .
 8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted
 provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt
 is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial
 distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
 .
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products
 derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 The End
