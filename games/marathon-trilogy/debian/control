Description: third part of Bungie's Marathon trilogy
 Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows
 it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign, "Blood Tides of Lh'owon," is a 20-level
 scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and aliens. More than that, the
 scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story's characters and the
 meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakening the ancient
 remnants of the S'pht, the player now faces a world where friends become
 enemies and all is not what it seems...
 .
 Marathon Infinity is the most popular Marathon game in online play, and is
 compatible with hundreds of community-made maps. This release includes the
 classic graphics, and revamped high-definition textures and weapons.
