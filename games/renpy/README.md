Ren'Py
======

Ren'Py is a programming language and runtime, intended to ease the creation
of visual-novel type games. It contains features that make it easy to
display thoughts, dialogue, and menus; to display images to the user; to
write game logic; and to support the saving and loading of games.

Ren'Py tries to be like an executable script, allowing you to get a working
game without much more effort than is required to type the game script into
the computer.

Ren'Py is implemented on top of Python, and that Python heritage shows
through in many places. Many Ren'Py statements allow Python expressions
to be used, and there are also Ren'Py statements that allow for the
execution of arbitrary Python code. Many of the less-used features of
Ren'Py are exposed to the user by way of Python. By only requiring use of
the simplest features of Python, it's hoped that Ren'Py will be usable by
all game authors.

This will create a Debian package of the pre-built version from the Ren'Py homepage.
