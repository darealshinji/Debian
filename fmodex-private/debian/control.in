Description: FMOD is a cross platform audio library and toolset
 FMOD is a cross platform audio library and toolset to let you easily
 implement the latest audio technologies into your title.
 .
 The FMOD Ex sound system is a revolutionary new audio engine for
 game developers, multimedia developers, sound designers, musicians
 and audio engineers, based on the years of experienced of Firelight
 Technologies(tm) previous product FMOD.
 It also aims high - to push the boundaries of audio implementation
 for games and the like while at the same time using minimal resources
 and being scalable. This new engine is written from the ground up
 since FMOD 3 was released and involves years of experience and
 feedback from FMOD users to create the most feature filled and easy
 to use product possible, without the rawbacks of legacy
 implementation that FMOD 3 may have suffered from its years of
 continuous development.
 .
 Since the libraries are missing sonames and have uncommon filenames,
 they will be saved as private libs to avoid trouble with the system.
