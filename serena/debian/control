Description: point-and-click adventure game
 How long has it been? A man sits in a distant getaway cabin waiting
 for his wife Serena. Where is she? Things in the cabin evoke memories,
 and the husband comes to a disturbing realization...
 .
 This short point-and-click adventure is the result of a massive collaborative
 effort between dozens of fans and designers of adventure games. Rallying to
 support the venerable genre and its passionate community, these developers
 have brought together a grim and highly detailed horror story in what is the
 largest, possibly even the first, game project of its kind.
 .
 Talents include crew from renowned indie companies Senscape, CBE Software,
 Infamous Quests, Digital Media Workshop, Guys from Andromeda, and many more.
