Serena
======

How long has it been? A man sits in a distant getaway cabin waiting for his wife Serena.
Where is she? Things in the cabin evoke memories, and the husband comes to a disturbing
realization... This short point-and-click adventure is the result of a massive collaborative
effort between dozens of fans and designers of adventure games.

To play this game you need to build the Dagon engine too.

Run `make` to build Serena.
