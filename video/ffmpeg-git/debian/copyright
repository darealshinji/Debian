Comment:
 Most files in FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
 version 2.1 or later (LGPL v2.1+), but some optional parts of FFmpeg are
 licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later (GPL v2+)
 and a few have different, but compatible licenses.
 .
 For building the Debian packages some of the GPL licensed files are used,
 so the resulting binaries are licensed under GPL v2+.
 The HTML documention /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-doc/manual/*.html in the ffmpeg-doc
 package is effectively licensed under GPL-3+, because during its creation
 the GPL-3+ licensed file doc/t2h.pm is used.
 .
 FFmpeg can also be combined with external libraries licensed under the
 Apache License 2.0, which would make the resulting binaries effectively
 licensed under the GPL v3+, or even with non-free libraries, which would
 make the resulting binaries unredistributable.
 But this is not done for the Debian packages.

  1.    INTRODUCTION
 The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software that implements
 the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.
 This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.
 .
 AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual
 audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by
 independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part
 of the MPEG specifications.
 .
 Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)
 may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners
 individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with
 the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license
 these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec
 software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.
 .
 Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,
 are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional
 applications information and documentation.

 2.    COPYRIGHT LICENSE

 Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted without
 payment of copyright license fees provided that you satisfy the following conditions:
 .
 You must retain the complete text of this software license in redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or
 your modifications thereto in source code form.
 .
 You must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation and/or other materials
 provided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in binary form.
 You must make available free of charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your
 modifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.
 .
 The name of Fraunhofer may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this library without
 prior written permission.
 .
 You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute the FDK AAC Codec
 software or your modifications thereto.
 .
 Your modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the software
 and the date of any change. For modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec, the term
 "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android" must be replaced by the term
 "Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android."

 respect to this software.
