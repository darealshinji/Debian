FFmpeg
======

Create a Debian package of the latest FFmpeg snapshot with latest libx264, libx265 and libfdk-aac enabled.
There will also be a ffmpeg-10bit binary linked against the 10bit versions of libx264 and libx265.

The package will NOT conflict with or overwrite your distribution's libav libraries.
