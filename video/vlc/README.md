VLC media player
================

Create a single package of the latest stable release of the VLC media player
with embedded libdvdcss, libdvdnav, libdvdread and ffmpeg.

You might have to manually delete a previous installation before installing the new version:
`sudo apt-get remove vlc vlc-dbg vlc-data vlc-nox vlc-plugin-fluidsynth vlc-plugin-jack vlc-plugin-notify vlc-plugin-samba vlc-plugin-sdl vlc-plugin-svg vlc-plugin-zvbi libvlc5 libvlc-dev libvlccore8 libvlccore-dev`

PS: On Unity it's recommended (but not required) to deactivate the tray icon in the settings.
