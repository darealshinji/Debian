Freedoom
========

Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom engine-based game which is
free software, in addition to maintaining compatibility with Doom
modifications (“mods”) that have been released by the continually-active
community since 1993.

Freedoom aims to create “IWAD” files for the engine, each of these
is an independent sub-project representing different aims towards game
design and compatibility with Doom mods:

Freedoom: Phase 1 - A four-chapter game, nine levels each,
totalling 36 levels. This project aims for compatibility
with The Ultimate Doom (also known as plain Doom or Doom 1).

Freedoom: Phase 2 - A 32-level chapter featuring extra monsters
and a double-barrelled shotgun. This project aims for
compatibility with Doom II.

Combined with any boom compatible Doom engine (such as prboom)
this will result in a complete Free Doom-based game.

This script downloads the prebuilt release version and creates Debian packages.
