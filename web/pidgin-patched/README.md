Pidgin IM
=========

On some ICQ accounts there's an annoying and pointless warning appearing on each startup.
This version of Pidgin will be patched so that the message won't appear anymore.

You must remove the currently installed Pidgin packages before you can install this package:
`sudo apt-get autoremove --purge libpurple0 pidgin-data`

PS: If you're running Ubuntu and Unity integration is not enabled try to run `make` with `UBUNTU=1`
