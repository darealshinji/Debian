Thunderbird
===========

Create a Debian package of the prebuilt version from the Thunderbird homepage.

This is intended for use on Debian, where the regular Thunderbird is not available.
On Ubuntu Thunderbird is always kept up to date and will overwrite this package.

Remember to build a new package when Thunderbird annouces a new release!
