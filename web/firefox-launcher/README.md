Firefox (launcher)
======================

Create a Debian package of the prebuilt version from the Firefox homepage.

This is intended for use on Debian, where the regular Firefox is not available.
On Ubuntu Firefox is always kept up to date.

On the first start, the files installed into /usr/lib will be copied into your home
directory and Firefox will be run from there. This will allow you to use its
built-in update function.
