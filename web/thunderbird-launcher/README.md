Thunderbird (launcher)
======================

Create a Debian package of the prebuilt version from the Thunderbird homepage.

This is intended for use on Debian, where the regular Thunderbird is not available.
On Ubuntu Thunderbird is always kept up to date.

On the first start, the files installed into /usr/lib will be copied into your home
directory and Thunderbird will be run from there. This will allow you to use its
built-in update function.
