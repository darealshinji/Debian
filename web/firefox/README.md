Firefox
=======

Create a Debian package of the prebuilt version from the Firefox homepage.

This is intended for use on Debian, where the regular Firefox is not available.
On Ubuntu Firefox is always kept up to date and will overwrite this package.

Remember to build a new package when Firefox annouces a new release!
