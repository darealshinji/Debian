Description: GNU Compiler Collection
 This build of the GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++
 and Objective-C as well as libraries for these languages. GCC was originally
 written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was
 developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the
 user's freedom.
 .
 The commands are prefixed with 'gcc4.9opt' and all files are installed into
 directories that won't conflict with you default installation of GCC.
 .
 GCC is patched to enable the following behaviour:
  * link with '--as-needed' and '-z relro' by default
  * enable Fortify Source ('-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2') for optimization levels > 0
  * turn on '-fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Wformat-security' by default
    for C, C++, ObjC, ObjC++ and set 'ssp-buffer-size' to 4
  * remove '-fstrict-aliasing' from '-O2' to use '-fno-strict-aliasing' by
    default
 .
 A copy of a recent version of the GNU Binutils will be included too.
 This copy will not conflict with your distributions default binutils.
