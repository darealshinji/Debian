Clang
=====

Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end for the LLVM compiler.
Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build compilers,
optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other compiler-related programs.
