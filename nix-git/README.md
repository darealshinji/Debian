Nix
===

Nix is a purely functional package manager.

It allows multiple versions of a package to be installed side-by-side,
ensures that dependency specifications are complete, supports atomic
upgrades and rollbacks, allows non-root users to install software, and
has many other features.
It is the basis of the NixOS Linux distribution, but it can be used equally
well under other Unix systems.
