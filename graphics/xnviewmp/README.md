XnViewMP
========

Graphic viewer, browser, converter.

XnView MP is the enhanced version to XnView.
It is a powerful cross-platform media browser, viewer and converter.
And it's compatible with more than 500 formats.

While an upstream Debian package is provided, it's packaged in a bad way
(missing depends line, pointless RPATHs, files stored in wrong directory, etc).
The package built from here will have these issues fixed.
