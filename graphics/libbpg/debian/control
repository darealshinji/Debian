Description: tools for manipulating BPG image format files
 BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is an image format whose purpose is to
 replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.
 .
 Its main advantages are:
  - High compression ratio. Files are much smaller than JPEG for similar
    quality.
  - Supported by most Web browsers with a small Javascript decoder.
  - Based on a subset of the HEVC open video compression standard.
  - Supports the same chroma formats as JPEG (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0,
    4:2:2, 4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha
    channel is supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also
    supported.
  - Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic
    range.
  - Lossless compression is supported.
  - Various metadata (such as EXIF, ICC profile, XMP) can be included.
