You Have to Win the Game (Steam version)
========================================

Originally released in May 2012, You Have to Win the Game has now arrived
on Steam with a more difficult remixed campaign and Playable Cat DLC!!
You Have to Win the Game is a free exploration platformer with
a retro 1980s PC aesthetic.
Run, jump, and avoid deadly pitfalls as you explore the ruins of
a lost world in search of hidden treasures and rare artifacts!
Experience the thrill of four-color CGA graphics and monotonic PC
speaker sounds! Or take a peek at the future of home entertainment
with the SIXTEEN-COLOR EGA GRAPHICS option!
Want a tougher challenge? Try YOLO mode! You only live once -- one
wrong move and it's back to the start of the game!

This script creates a Debian package of the Steam version of "You Have to Win the Game".
This requires that you have the game installed via [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286100/).
Once you have installed the created Debian package, you don't need Steam anymore to play the game.
