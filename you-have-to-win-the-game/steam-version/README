This script creates a Debian package of the Steam version of "You Have to Win the Game".
This requires that you have the game installed on Steam ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/286100/ ).
Once you have installed the Debian package you created, you don't need Steam anymore to play the game.

To build the package run './build.sh'

To install the build-dependencies run 'sudo apt-get install debhelper libgl1-mesa-glx'
