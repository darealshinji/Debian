Enhanced aacPlus general audio codec
====================================

HE-AAC audio v2 (with SBR + PS) is the superb audio encoder used to encode
high quality audio at really low bitrates (32 kbit/s).

Depending on law in your country, you may need a license for distribution,
any use, commercial use or even development.

Note: since the "source code" includes two 32 bit static libraries whithout
their sources, enhaacplusenc can only be encoded as a 32 bit binary.
It's recommended to use fdk-aac instead.
