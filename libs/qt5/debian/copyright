 Appendix I MySQL FLOSS License Exception
 ****************************************
 .
                      Version 0.3, 10 February 2005
 .
 The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software-only
 Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the "FLOSS Exception").
 .
 Exception Intent
 ================
 .
 We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS")
 applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
 libraries (the "Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses
 are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the
 "GPL").
 .
 Legal Terms and Conditions
 ==========================
 .
 As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the
 GPL:
 .
   1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
      entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS
      Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in
      section 1, as long as:
 .
        a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
           Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
           Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and
           which can reasonably be considered independent and separate
           works in themselves,
 .
        b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not
           derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be
           considered independent and separate works in themselves,
 .
          i
                are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
                listed below, and
 .
          ii
                the object code or executable form of those sections are
                accompanied by the complete corresponding
                machine-readable source code for those sections on the
                same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the
                corresponding object code or executable forms of those
                sections, and
 .
        c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
           Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
           medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
           considered independent and separate works in themselves which
           are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative Work
           or a FLOSS Work.
 .
      If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be
      copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
      conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from MySQL
      AB.
 .

      that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free Software
      Foundation's Free Software Definition
      (`http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html') or version 1.9 of

   3. Definitions
 .
        a. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning
           provided in the GPL.
 .
        b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.
 .
   4. Applicability This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that
      contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the Program may be
      distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception.  If you
      create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the
      Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS
      Exception is not available for that work; thus, you must remove
      the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL
      in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices.  You may
      choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the
      terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that
      copy of the Program, provided that the copy has never been
      modified by you or any third party.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.
 .
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
      (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
      to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.
 .
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.
 .

 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
     CompuServe Incorporated."
